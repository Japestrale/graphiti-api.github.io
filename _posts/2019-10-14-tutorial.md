title: Tutorial Write-Ups Are Out!
---

Though we've long had a [sample application](https://github.com/graphiti-api/employee_directory) with step-by-step diffs, we've been missing a full walkthrough. That now exists! Start with [Step 0: Bootstrapping]({{site.github.url}}/tutorial/step_0).

These write-ups will tell you the relevant code and commands, but
they'll also give helpful context around the decisions Graphiti makes.
Even if you're already a Graphiti user, I suggest checking it out!
