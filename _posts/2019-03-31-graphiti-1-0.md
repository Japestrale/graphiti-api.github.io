title: Graphiti 1.0 Released ðŸŽ‰
---

This project has gone through a number of iterations over the past three years. I'm happy to say we've now released 1.0, committing to semantic versioning. Graphiti has now seen enough use, across a wide variety of scenarios, that we can commit to no backwards-incompatible changes for a long while, and a changelog for future releases.

We'll be writing more in this blog about our future roadmap. Stay tuned!
