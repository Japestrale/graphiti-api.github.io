title: Graphiti 1.1 Released
---

Our first minor version bump centers around an important update:
**better errors for clients**. This is the first phase of work to allow us to provide more actionable errors to API users who might not also be developers of the API itself. This was brought to us by Graphiti maintainer [Wade Tandy](https://github.com/wadetandy).

Previously, when a client sent a bad write request to the server -
unwritable attributes/relationships, or bad types - we would render the
same generic 500 error JSON. We now render helpful error messages, so
third-party clients know how to correct their requests.

This is currently only affecting invalid writes, but the foundation laid
will be extendable to reads as well.
